**Question:**

**If we are going to deploy this on production, what do you think is the next improvement that you will prioritize next? This can be a feature, a tech debt, or an architectural design.**

- Implement a secure authentication system that grants several user roles (such as administrator, manager, and employee) with varied levels of access. This maintains data security and privacy by ensuring that only authorized people can carry out certain actions.

- Management of Employee Profiles: Enlarge the employee profile to include more information, such as contact details, job title, department, date of employment, and performance metrics. This can give HR and management a thorough understanding of every employee.
  
- Management of Payroll and Benefits: The program should be expanded to handle processing of payroll, including deductions, taxes, bonuses, and benefits. This can assure correct net income computations.

- Timesheet tracking: Include a timesheet to monitor employee attendance, working hours, and overtime.
